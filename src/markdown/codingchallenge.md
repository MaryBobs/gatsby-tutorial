###31 days of coding challenges

Throughout May I committed to completing the daily challenge posted by Leetcode.

These were quite computer science type problems so pretty different to the sort of things I covered on the CodeClan course.

It definitely taught me a lot and has given me an interest in algorithms and plenty of things to research further.

I couldn't solve every problem on my own, but I learnt something from all of them, even those where I had to work through other peoples solutions to understand them.

It also got me into the habit of coding something everyday, I really enjoyed this and it would be a good thing to keep up.
