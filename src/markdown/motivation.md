#How to keep on, keeping on!

Being unemployed at this time isn't always easy. I'm finding it essential to stick to a routine, and my alarm still goes off at the same time every morning. Keeping focussed can be tricky so I've started scheduling my 'working' week and setting deadlines to make sure I keep on track. My core work hours are 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday and I plan it out each week the same way I would plan my time when working in a job. Of course things change through the week but I'm finding since I started doing this I'm getting so much more done and not being so easily distracted.

##One thing I'm really missing is walking to and from work each day
It was about a two mile walk and I loved being able to just switch off. Having that time to listen to a podcast or audiobook or just enjoy the fabulous city I live in, without feeling guilty that I should be doing something else! In the first couple of weeks of being stuck at home my daily average steps went from 15,000 to about 3000! So I've got back to the walking and now go out at 6am every day, when it's still nice and quiet, and get at least 3 or 4 miles done before breakfast. It's a great way to start the day and means when I sit down at 9am to work I'm fully awake and keen to get started.
