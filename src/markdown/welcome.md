#Hi there!

##So, I've entered the world of blogging as a way to keep me on track and focussed during this strange time.
I guess it's customary to start with a little bit about me. My name is Mary and I live in Edinburgh, Scotland with my partner Ed. Last October I quit my job working in University administration to embark on a big career change. I spent 4 months completing a full time Professional Software Development course at the lovely CodeClan. I extended the course by two weeks to volunteer with a team of my course mates to work on a community project building a management system for a local youth centre. I finished at the start of March and launched full on into the hunt for the first job, just as the global pandemic really hit the UK and the world ground to a halt!

##I'm old enough to know even the best laid plans can go off the rails. 

I had sensible back-up solutions for work to keep paying the bills until I could find that elusive first tech job. However, I hadn't really allowed for the current circumstances. So instead I find myself trying to keep motivated and learning while stuck at home for who knows how long. I've started this blog and am building a little website to publish it on. I'm using this time to keep on learning and the idea is to keep adding to the site as I go. I'm also hoping committing to a blog at least once a week will help keep me motivated and on track.

##At the moment there's no way for people to comment on posts (*adds note to to-do list) but please feel free to get in touch with me through LinkedIn or Twitter if you want to say hi!
