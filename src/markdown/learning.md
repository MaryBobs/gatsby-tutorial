#Back to School!

The first few weeks after graduating from CodeClan I threw myself into job hunting and planned to continue learning alongside this by using online resources. However as more and more companies responded to say they were putting recruitment on hold, along with flat out rejections from others, I've refocussed how I prioritise my time a bit. I was applying for everything that interested me however unrealistic and the constant rejections were just soul destroying. Jobs are still being advertised but opportunities for new junior developers are extremely limited. Understandable at a time when companies are unsure about what the next few months will bring. I am of course still applying but I'm making learning my first priority until things start to pick up again and only applying for things that interest me and that realistically I might be considered for.

##Where to start

I'm very grateful for the huge range on online resources out there but it can also be a bit overwhelming just knowing where to start and what to focus on. I think I wasted a couple of weeks trying different things every day, not always finishing some before a new exciting course or talk caught my eye. I've took a step back and decided to narrow my focus a bit to JavaScript and React for now as I really enjoy both. Though I'm still collecting a list of future courses and projects to explore when I have time!
