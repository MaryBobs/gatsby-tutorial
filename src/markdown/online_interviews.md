#Alongside the job hunt I've also been involved in a couple of volunteer projects in the past few weeks.

Volunteering was one of those things I always wanted to do more of but struggled to find the time to fit in with my previous job. These are the two organisations I've been involved with, both set up from scratch in response to the Covid-19 pandemic:

##Empty Kitchens Full Hearts
I'd been following the work of EKFH on social media since the start of the lockdown. They are a great group of chefs who have come together to provide meal packs for people during the current crisis. When I saw they were opening a second kitchen and distribution unit near me I got in touch to see if I could help out, making it clear I probably shouldn't be let loose in the kitchen itself! They needed people to help with packing up the meal packs and organising them ready for deliveries which sounded a bit more suitable and I signed up to go along. I helped out for a few weeks and it was fantastic to be involved with a group who are really making a difference to people's daily lives. If you're interested in finding out more, or would like to give them a donation you can find them here: https://www.facebook.com/EmptyKitchensFullHearts/

##Scottish Tech Army
I've also signed up to the Scottish Tech Army. Set up with the aim of "mobilising Scotlandâ€™s tech talent to build solutions to the challenges posed by coronavirus" you can find out more here https://www.scottishtecharmy.org/
Being new to tech I was a bit unsure about joining and being more hinderance than a help. However so far it's been a good experience and there has been a real effort to involve junior people alongside those with more experience. Projects are increasing every day and I'm hoping to be able to get involved in one that fits with my interests and be able to help out and learn at the same time.
