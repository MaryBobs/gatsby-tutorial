#Women of React, 2020

Yesterday was my first tech conference, attended from the comfort of my living room while eating cookies and not having to worry about what to wear! Women of React, as the name suggests was female speakers covering various topics related to React. Although the conference itself was open to anyone who was interested. As someone making a career change when they are a bit older, I was nervous about attending (even virtually!) and feeling like an outsider. However it was a fantastic event and everyone on the conference chat was really friendly. I came away really inspired and with loads of notes and links saved to follow-up on.

###If you had told me a year ago I'd be spending my Saturday evening sitting in front of my computer listening to talks about programming until 1am I don't think I would have believed you. But I loved the whole evening and would have happily done it all again the next day!
