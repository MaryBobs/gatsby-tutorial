#You wouldn't be reading this otherwise!

So at the moment I have various projects and bits and pieces all over the place and I've been meaning to start putting them all in one place. Deciding what to use for my website though proved a bit trickier than expected, this is my third version! I realised however that I was hugely overcomplicating things. I actually built a whole website with blog in React but decided it wasn't the most practical solution for what I needed and to be honest was a bit overkill for a personal site. However I still wanted to stick with JavaScript and React so I did a bit of research and found Gatsby, a free and open source framework based on React. I love it, and that is what this site is built with.

At the moment it is just a blog page and an about page, but I have sketched out how it will expand and have a to-do list of information and features to add. Next week's task is to add in some of the projects I've worked on.
